# Summary
	Files copied or processed by Grunt, to be deployed as product version.
	We needn't commit the product to Git because they are generated by developing project.
	(only the package.json files are differently)
	
# Package Structure
	Similar but simpler than developing project.
	
## Directories
* resources
	Only the necessary web resource for front-end working. The files are processed by Grunt,
	e.g. compressed, concatnented, uglified or optimized. 
* node_modules
	 The node dependency modules. it's created by package.json 
* views
	Ejs views necessary for product (Ejs files related with test are removed).
	The resource.ejs is included into host-page as for scripts and css libraries. They are 
	locale resource in developing stage, but CDN+fallback in product package. Grunt will do
	that automatically.
* routes/services/data
	The 3-tiers back-end. We don't think these files should be uglified in product package.
	If there were some source modules only working for developing, remove them by grunt.

## Files
* README.md
	This file.
* package.json
	The node modules install file, only the necessary dependencies for product version.
* app.js
	The main App routine.
* start.js
	The starting js file. There maybe several starting files in developing projects, but only
	one in product package.
